Tab Sorter Cleaner is a Chromium extension that helps you sort tabs, close
duplicates, group tabs by domain, and review recent activity.

## Data We Access

- **Tabs**: Read tab titles and URLs to sort and deduplicate tabs.
- **Page Content**: Read visible page text to improve topic grouping.
- **History**: Read visit times for open tabs to show "last visited."
- **Storage**: Store tab time tracking data locally on your device.
- **Tab Groups**: Create and manage groups in the current window.

## How We Use Data

- All data is used only to provide the extension features inside your browser.
- Page text is accessed locally at the time you run topic grouping.
- Tab time data is stored locally using Chrome's `storage.local` API.

## Data Sharing

- We do **not** sell or share data with third parties.
- No data is sent to external servers.

## Data Retention

- Tab time data remains in local storage until you remove the extension or
  clear extension data.
